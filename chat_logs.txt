2025-07-26 20:52:29,561 - assistant: The top 3 key terms from the 2020-related content in the files appear to be:

1. Product Quality
2. Query Handling
3. Communication

These are highlighted as key drivers of customer commitment and important experience areas for the EIPM (ENOC) customers in 2020 and also reflected in surrounding years' analyses. Product quality consistently emerges as a strength, while query handling and communication are areas needing attention or improvement.

Additional important terms often associated with these are Ordering Process and Billing & Invoicing, but the main top three are product quality, query handling, and communication in the 2020 context.

This is supported by text stating:
- "‘Product quality’ ‘Query Handling’ ‘Communication’ and ‘Ordering Process’ emerged as key drivers of commitment at experience level" (EIPM 2021, reflecting 2020 insights)
- Continuous improvement noted in product quality, but query handling is declining, showing these as focus areas .

If you want, I can provide more detailed insights or other key terms from the 2020 report.
